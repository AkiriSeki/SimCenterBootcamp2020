C: Assignment to Test Setup
===========================

.. note::

   The purpose of this exercise is to ensure that you are all ready to start programming at the start of the **C** part of the course. Because we will be spending time on parallel programming and showing how best to use **Tapis**, you will be using the `**Frontera** <https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/frontera>`_ system and they provide a comprehinsive set of `usage notes <https://frontera-portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guide/>`_ . The following is a brief overview of it with Linux commands for this workshop.

   1. Using **git** on a daily basis to update the code base.
   2. Using **ssh** to login to Frontera from your terminal.
   3. Using **Linux** commands once logged in as Frontera is a Linux system.
   4. Compiling **C** code and running the compiled application on Frontera.
      
The following is a list of items you need to perform. For those of you who followed our **Python** course, steps **1** and **2** are not needed.

#. In your browser you need to sign up for `github <https://github.com>`_. If you have difficulties they have a `page devoted to signing up <https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account>`_

#. After signing up and logging in, navigate in your browser to the SimCenterBottcamp2020 `git page <https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/SimCenterBootcamp2020>`_. At the website, click on the **Fork**, button at top right. This will create a fork of the repo under your own github username and take you to the main page for that repo.

#. Now under the **Code** pull down menu on this new page, copy the https address into your clipboard. 

#. Install and then pair the TACC Token app on your phone. Instructions can be found at the `TACC website <https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/tutorials/multifactor-authentication>`_
   
#. Now we login to TACC. From Powershell terminal if on Windows10 or a terminal window if using MacOS, enter the following (replacing of course your DesignSafe account name with YOUR_NAME) and provide your designsafe login and the TACC token. For the TACC token open the TACC Token app you have installed on your phone.

   .. code::

      ssh YOUR_NAME@frontera.tacc.utexas.edu

#. Now let us clone the repo that you just forked on github. To do so type the following:

   .. code::
      
      git clone https://github.com/YOUR GIT LOGIN/SimCenterBootcamp2020.git

#. This last command has created a new folder in your current directory named **SimCenterBootcamp2020**. We now want you to **cd** (change directory) into that directory. This is done by you typing the following:

   .. code::

      cd SimCentercBootcamp2020

#. Now we want you to issue the following command, which will add a pointer, called upstream, to the master SimCenterBootcamp2020 repo that you forked:

   .. code::
     
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/SimCenterBootcamp2020.git

#. Now let us go back to your home folder. Here we will create a new folder named **hello** and get you to create your first **C** program in that folder.

   .. code::
     
     cd ~
     mkdir hello
     cd hello
     emacs hello.c

#. The last command you issues, **emacs** starts one of the few editors available to you on Frontera and opens up a file named **hello.c**. We now want you to place in that file the following:

   .. code::

      #include <stdio.h>
      int main(int argc, char **argv) {
         printf("Hello World\n");
      }

#. To save the file enter the following

   .. code::
	   
	   <Control> x <Control> s   

#. To quit emacs, enter now the following:

   .. code::

   	   <Control> x <Control> c   


#. Now we want you to compile the file to create an application called **a.out**. To do this type the following

   .. code::
      
      icc hello.c

#. To test the code and be responsible users while doing so, we want you to start an interactive session on a compute node. To do this type the following:

   .. code::
      
      idev

#. Once the session has started, you can run the application by typing the following:

   .. code::
      
      ./a.out

#. Application should run and output "Hello World" to the screen. You are done and have succesfully compiled and run your first **C** program. To now exit the interactive environment and also exit your sesssion at TACC type the following:

   .. code::
      
      exit
      exit

      
.. warning::
   #. Your TACC login name is the same as your DesignSafe login. If you do not have one yet, you need to obtain one from their `website <https://www.designsafe-ci.org/>`_.
   
   #. If you cannot log into Frontera, send us an email with your designsafe login as we have not added your login name to our allocation.
      
   #. If you have problems compiling the code, try and use the compiler messages to see what you did wrong.
